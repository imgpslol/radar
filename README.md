How to Radar

Once Radar is running, it will ask you to provide an IP address and choose a scanning flag. Here's how to use it:
Basic Flow

    Enter the IP address to scan.
        Example: 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.1.1:80,443 (if you want to scan specific ports).
    Choose a scan mode by entering one of the following flags:
        -n: Normal scan (scans the most common ports: 80, 443, 22, 8080, 3306).
        -udp: UDP scan (scans common UDP ports like 53, 67, 111, 161, 162).
        -tcp: TCP scan (scans common TCP ports like 22, 25, 53, 70, 80, 113, 443).
        -all: Full scan (scans a wide range of common ports: 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 67, 80, 443, 110, 135, 139, 445, 1433, 3306, 3389, 8080).
    Optionally, enable verbose mode to get more detailed information about each connection attempt. You will be asked if you want verbose output.
